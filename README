The following algorithms are implemented:
* CBC
* SVM
* LW index
* Davies Bouldin Index
* Silhouette index
* Dunn Index and its variants
* Ball and Hall index
* Xu-index
* CH index
* Hartigan index
* WB-index


To use:

1. Unpack the Datasets.rar which can be download at "ftp://nepsnet.com:25602/"

2. For the testing of NEWSGROUPS and REUTERS set, put it into the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\orginSample"; for the rest of datasets, put it into the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_StemedSample",and meanwhile keep the folder ".\DataMiningSample\LW\orginSample" empty, since the samples in these datasets have been preprocessed.

3. Run the main function in the file "LWindex.java"

4. The results will put into the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW" after the procedures finished.
The results in the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_outputfile_1" is for Information Gain (IG) feature selection algorithm;
The results in the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_outputfile_2" is for Chi-Square (CS) feature selection algorithm;
The results in the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_outputfile_3" is for Mutual Information (MI) feature selection algorithm;
The results in the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_outputfile_4" is for Cross Entropy (CE) feature selection algorithm;
The results in the folder: ".\DataMiningSample\LW\0_outputfile_5" is for random feature selection algorithm as described in our paper;
